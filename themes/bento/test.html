		"description": "<p>Wellington Test Professionals Network presents</p> <p>\n\nAutomation Testing (A Functional Perspective) - Abhijeet Singh </p> <p>\n\n\n\nIn this talk, we will explore what automation testing is all about, and how it compliments manual functional testing. How automation testers can work closely with the manual functional test team, and:</p> <p>\n\n - Help them to reduce their effort, and </p> <p>\n\n - In turn, get the expertise from the manual functional test team to create more effective and more efficient automated tests</p> <p>\n\n\n\nBased on his own experiences, Abhijeet will demonstrate a few instances where using automation tests are extremely helpful to the manual functional test team. </p> <p>\n\n\n\nThe presentation will be followed by a networking session with drinks and nibbles provided by TPN.</p> <p>\n\nAbout The Speaker</p> <p>\n\nAbhijeet is a passionate automation tester, and likes to explore new innovative ways to implement automation testing. He has experience in implementing various frameworks in QTP/UFT on large projects for various Banks.  He is currently working with Infosys for Westpac NZ in their automation team, and is working on developing a new automation framework that collaborates well with the manual functional test team. </p> <p>\n\n       </p> <p>\n\nTPN wish to thank TPN for sponsoring the refreshments.</p> <p>\n\n     </p> <p>\n\nTPN wish to thank Westpac for providing the venue. </p> <p>\n\n\n\nRegistration Details:</p> <p>\n\nTPN is a non-profit organisation set up to support all Wellington testing. Confirming attendance at this event is a commitment to attend. Please do not book if you will not be attending.  Building access restrictions mean you must be in the door by 5.15pm.</p> <p>\n\nIITP members and non-members welcome.</p> <p>\n\nNOTE: Please pay $5 at the door (cash only)</p>",
